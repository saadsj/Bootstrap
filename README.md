# Bootstrap
I got the jumbotron from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/jumbotron/ and I edited it. I added "365 Fitness" along with <center> to center it.
For the images I had to use this link https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp because it provided better information than bootstrap. At first it was messy because I was using the images directing from the internet. I figured that saving them made it easier.
For the navbar I used https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/navbar/. This was much simplier after figuring everything out. All I needed to do was remove and reword a few things.
